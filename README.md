Built and developed overnight... I really need to sleep more...

I conduct exams and host practice contests on HackerRank. This is a useful tool to gather Leaderboard Information.  
It generates an excel sheet for each contestID as well as a final Leaderboard consisting of the total sum of all leaderboards.

## Usage Instructions:
**You can insert your contest ID's in the box in the first window. You are meant to insert a single or multiple ID's separated by comma's( , ).**
**EX : If the URL is, https://www.hackerrank.com/contests/projecteuler/challenges**, then the contest ID is **projecteuler**
